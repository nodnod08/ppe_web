				<h4>Solid Waste and Recycling (Toner Cartridge)</h4>
				<small
					>The impact of recycling ink cartridges, on our environment, is monumental. It isn’t
					simply the ink that is being recycled. Plastic and metal waste are being diverted from our
					landfills. When the plastic casings of the cartridges begin to decompose, poisonous toxins
					are seeping into our soil and water. Reducing cartridge manufacturing lowers net energy
					use, which ultimately impacts climate change. Further, reducing the amount of plastic
					products being used reduces the amount of oil that is consumed. Plastic cannot be
					manufactured, without oil. Eventually, greenhouse gases are affected, with respect to
					global climate change.</small

				<h4>
					Recycling ink and toner cartridges keeps millions of pounds of solid waste each year from
					landfills
				</h4>
				<p>
					As a society we are printing, copying and faxing more than ever. Used ink and toner
					cartridges are clogging our nation’s landfills, as many as 400 million per year!
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Because cartridges are a petroleum based product, they take hundreds of years to
					decompose, adding to the already serious environmental problem. Cartridges are made of
					plastic, and it takes up to three quarts of oil to manufacture a single cartridge.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Ink cartridges are considered e-waste; they are harmful to the environment and can take
					eons to decompose. Companies and consumers should recycle their old ones, and when ink
					cartridges are purchased, go with refilled ones, which work just like conventional
					cartridges.

				<h4>Environmental Impact</h4>
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>
						GHGs (green house gases) emissions from manufacturing a single mono toner cartridge have
						been calculated to approximately 4.8 kg CO2; per cartridge.
					</li>
					<li>Each year over 350 million cartridges are thrown out to landfills.</li>
					<li>
						By 2012 500 million laser cartridges and 1.8 billion ink cartridges will be dumped in
						landfills.
					</li>
					<li>
						Each cartridge becomes 3.5 pounds of solid waste sitting in a landfill and can take up
						to 450 to 1000 years to decompose.
